# Unit 18 Homework: Citi Bike Analytics

Background
Citi-Bikes
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Links to an external site.program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data Links to an external site.webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.


Instructions
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.

The following are questions those were answered on this job.

What kind of ride types are mostly used by the member type in total during the chosen period?

Rides trend for the chosen period based from November to December period?

How many rides are starting from the starting station?

What are the top starting stations based on no. of rides?

What are the peak starting hours when bikes are used during the winter months?

What are the peak ending hours when bikes are used during the winter months?

No. of rides for each location on the map?

Ride types available from each starting station?



Create your final presentation:

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.
